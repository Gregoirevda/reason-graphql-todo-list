Run this project:

```
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run build` step), open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. 
Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.

If you want to look at the graphQL schema, you can see it here:

You can fork it and play with it in the apollo-launchpad
