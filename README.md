Run this project:

```
npm install
npm start
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed, your browser will run a local server on an available port. 
Then modify whichever file in `src` and the page will reflect the changes automatically.

If you want to look at the graphQL schema, you can see it here:

You can fork it and play with it in the apollo-launchpad
